    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Mapo Tofu Burger is an abominably delicious hybrid of cuisines that horrifies and delights people the world over.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb Firm Tofu</li>
        <li>1/3lb Ground Pork</li>
        <li>1 packet Mapo Tofu Sauce (storebought is okay here)</li>
        <li>4 Sesame Seed Buns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the water out of your tofu so it isn't so wet. You know how to do this.</li>
        <li>Since we're working with firm tofu here, crumble it up into chunks and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add ground pork to a pan over medium heat with a tablespoon of oil until it just starts to brown.</li>
        <li>Once there is some color on the pork, stir in your mapo sauce packet and reduce the heat to low, using the sauce to deglaze the bottom of the pan if necessary.</li>
        <li>Add your crumbled tofu to the pan and stir it through, allowing it to warm up in the sauce. Cook for about 3 minutes, until the mixture has heated through and the tofu has absorbed some sauce.</li>
        <li>Once the texture is to your liking, turn off the heat and scoop your saucy meat and tofu onto a bun and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
